They are mutiple versions of the autocad files the "final.dwg" have the best fitting panel for the upper panel,The "final(2).dwg" have the rest of the panels.
I higly suggest looking at the lengths of every file and decide upon which one suits your needs the best.
Note: pick the transparent plexy insted of white color or any other color espicaly for the upper panel as it works best with IR sensor.
Pics of the pill box avaible at SC folder, don't hesitate to contact me about any details, this project is still under development.
